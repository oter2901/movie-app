# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.

# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
movie_api/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
movie_api/log/*
movie_api/tmp/*
movie_api/log/.keep
movie_api/tmp/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
movie_api/storage/*
!/storage/.keep
movie_api/.byebug_history

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
movie_api/config/master.key
